  "assessment": "1. Perform an initial assessment while starting immediate bronchodilator treatment:\n   * Examine the patient.\n   * Rapidly assess the severity.\n2. If you suspect anaphylaxis, treat according to the [Anaphylaxis](https://canterbury.communityhealthpathways.org/19327.htm) pathway.\n3. A lack of bronchodilator response is a key indicator of ongoing severity and the need for hospital admission.\n4. Take a history once the patient starts to stabilise:\n   * Rapidity of onset of symptoms.\n   * Current medications, how many puffs of beta-agonist inhaler the patient has used in the last 24 hours, and whether a spacer has been used correctly.\n   * Co-morbidities.\n   * Recent asthma control.\n   * Pregnancy.\n   * Exposure to allergens and smoking status.\n5. Consider other causes of acute dyspnoea:\n   * Respiratory – pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax and upper airway obstruction, pneumonia\n   * Cardiac – acute coronary syndrome, acute heart failure, arrhythmia\n   * Anxiety or hyperventilation\n6.
