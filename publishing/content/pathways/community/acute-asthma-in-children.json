Look for signs of life-threatening asthma.\n   * If present, proceed to Management immediately.\n   * If absent, decide on the severity of the asthma - mild, moderate, or severe. Wheeze is not a good indicator of severity. If moderate or severe, measure oxygen saturation.\n4. Check and record the child's:\n   * risk of exposure to smoking.\n   * most recent influenza vaccine.\n   * height and weight.\n",
