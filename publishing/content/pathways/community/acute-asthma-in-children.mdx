assessment: "1. Take a **brief** history and perform rapid examination.\n2. Decide if asthma is the most likely diagnosis. Consider:\n   * the <dropBox title=\"likelihood of acute asthma\" content={<>Likelihood of acute asthma:      * Asthma:   * causes episodic wheezing and shortness of breath that responds reliably to bronchodilator treatment.   * is rarely diagnosed unless there have been at least 2 to\_3 episodes. However, in some cases it may be the only likely diagnosis even on the first episode.   * is rare, but not excluded, in children younger than 1\_year.\_[Bronchiolitis](https://canterbury.communityhealthpathways.org/153409.htm)\_is the main cause of episodic wheeze in infants and should not be treated with a bronchodilator. If the following risk factors are present, consider whether a trial of asthma treatment is appropriate:   * Parents or siblings with asthma   * Infantile atopic eczema   * Repeated wheezing with viral infections   * Acute asthma:   * is accompanied by objective signs of wheezing, increased work of breathing, and hyperexpansion of the chest.   * usually responds (by decreased work of breathing) to inhaled bronchodilator treatment, whereas few other conditions do so.   * Cough is common in asthma, but is very rarely the sole symptom and is not specific for asthma. See\_[Cough in Children](https://canterbury.communityhealthpathways.org/13294.htm).   * A history of interval symptoms, particularly wheeze in response to exercise, cold air, or specific allergens, makes asthma likely.   * A family history of asthma, and atopic disease in the child (e.g. atopic eczema, hay fever, positive skin prick tests to inhaled allergens) increase the likelihood that wheezing is due to asthma.</>} />.\n   * alternative diagnoses.\n3. Look for signs of life-threatening asthma.\n   * If present, proceed to Management immediately.\n   * If absent, decide on the\_severity of the asthma\_– mild, moderate, or severe. Wheeze is not a good indicator of severity. If moderate or severe, measure oxygen saturation.\n4. Check and record the child's:\n   * risk of exposure to smoking.\n   * most recent influenza vaccine.\n   * height and weight.\n\nThis is a <dropBox title=\"bit of extra info\" /> within text.\n"
