name: Acute Asthma in Children
audience: hospital
assessment: "1. Take a brief history and perform a rapid examination.\n2. Decide whether asthma is the most likely diagnosis. Consider:\n\n<dropBox\n  title=\"likelihood\"\n  content={<>\n    **Likelihood of acute asthma**\n    \n    Asthma causes episodic wheezing and shortness of breath that responds reliably to bronchodilator treatment.\n    \n    Asthma is rarely diagnosed unless there have been at least 2 to 3 episodes. However, in some cases it may be the only likely diagnosis even on the first episode.\n    \n    Acute asthma is accompanied by objective signs of wheezing, increased work of breathing, and hyperexpansion of the chest.\n    \n    Cough is common in asthma, but is very rarely the sole symptom and is not specific for asthma. See [Cough in Children](http://www.healthpathways.org.nz/loginfiles/Landing.aspx?from=4e41688935b44350a450fc24ed1c20c2\\&page=13294.htm).\n    \n    A history of interval symptoms, particularly wheeze in response to exercise, cold air, or specific allergens, makes asthma likely.\n    \n    A family history of asthma, and atopic disease in the child (e.g. atopic eczema, hay fever, positive skin prick tests to inhaled allergens) increase the likelihood that wheezing is due to asthma.\n    \n    Asthma is rare, but not excluded, in children younger than 1 year. Bronchiolitis is the main cause of episodic wheeze in infants, and should not be treated with a bronchodilator. If the following risk factors are present, discuss with the senior medical officer (SMO) whether a trial of asthma treatment is appropriate:\n    \n    * Parents or siblings with asthma\n    * Infantile atopic eczema\n    * Repeated wheezing with viral infections\n    \n    Acute asthma usually responds (by decreased work of breathing) to inhaled bronchodilator treatment, whereas few other conditions do so.\n    \n    In older children, a significant bronchodilator response on spirometry, or positive exercise challenge test, can be helpful to confirm asthma.\n  </>}\n/>\n\n* <dropBox title=\"alternative diagnoses\" content={<>Alternative diagnoses      * Bronchiolitis – a viral infection occurring in children younger than 12 months. Usually associated with fine inspiratory crackles, as well as wheeze.   * Transient infant wheeze:   * Recurrent virus-triggered episodes of wheeze in children with no risk factors for asthma, except smoking exposure in pregnancy.   * Usually does not persist past age 3 years.      Less common causes:      * Hyperventilation – increased rate and work of breathing, but with excellent chest expansion and air entry, and no wheeze.   * Inhalation of foreign body:   * Wheeze, cough, and/or shortness of breath, of abrupt onset usually associated with a choking episode (sometimes this is not observed).   * Wheeze may be unilateral and monophonic but not always.   * No response to bronchodilators.   * Anaphylaxis – sudden onset, usually associated with rash, angio-oedema, and sometimes with stridor.   * Stridor:   * Sometimes reported by parents as wheeze but is a predominantly inspiratory monophonic sound.   * Causes include croup and upper airway disorders.   * Laryngeal disorders associated with symptoms of cough, choking and difficulty breathing, particularly during competitive exercise in older children and teenagers.   * Aspiration syndromes – usually associated with swallowing disorders, e.g., with low tone, developmental delay, neuromuscular disorders, or congenital oesophageal disorders.   * Congenital disorders:   * Include bronchogenic cysts compressing airway, other masses, or vascular rings compressing airway, tracheomalacia, or bronchomalacia.   * Usually manifest by constant or highly predictable wheezing and/or cough.   * Usually do not present with acute respiratory distress.</>} />\n\n3\\.
