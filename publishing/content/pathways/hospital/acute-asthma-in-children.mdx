      Salbutamol and hyperventilation
      
      Very frequent doses of salbutamol can give rise to hyperventilation, with increased work and depth of breathing, good air entry, and no wheeze. Do not mistake for continuing asthma. Remember that small airway obstruction causes prolonged expiration. Stop salbutamol and give only as needed for wheezing.
