**Spacer**

* First-line community and hospital management of acute asthma is a metered-dose inhaler (MDI) via a spacer, except in severe or [life-threatening cases](https://canterbury.hospitalhealthpathways.org/188574.htm), when respiratory effort may be insufficient to move the valve.
* A small minority of children dislike spacers and may be better off with a nebuliser in hospital to avoid unnecessary distress or anxiety.
* Small volume spacers are suitable for children of all ages.
* Spacers should be fitted with a well-sealing face mask for children who cannot seal their lips around a mouthpiece (usually children aged younger than 3 years).
* In children younger than 6 years, avoid large volume spacers. They can be used above this age, but are less convenient than small volume spacers.
* If a patient aged older than 6 years has brought their own large volume spacer to hospital, this may be used. Consider educating the family about the suitability and convenience of small volume spacers.
* See Lippincott – [Metered-dose Inhaler with Spacer](http://procedures.lww.com/lnp/view.do?pId=729380\&s=p).
